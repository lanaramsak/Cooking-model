In conclusion, we breathly summarize our group work. Theme of the work was Cooking Process Simulation. We chose the program language Python. As was said before, we see some benefits in using it. also to use the json files to be the program more user friendly and also to have it more visually clear. \\

The results, that have been gotten, are describe in detail in the previous chapter. The main goal is ....\\

We conclude that We enjoyed the group work. We are familiar that our simulation program can get improved in the future. Unfortunately, there are some missing points-small mistakes. However, we hope that they have no that big impact on the running the program and the simulation in general.  


- problems code, did in simpy, turned ou to not be good \\
- three recipes, simulate the results, some especially with a cause \\
- the order does affect the time, best to do long tasks first, with more cooks there is a diffrence, with one it is almost not important \\
- got similar order, didn't take into account things like being fresh, with some tasks order not important \\
- number of cooks only important to some number, big difference between 1 and 2, resources highly effect the time, need to have more pans/knives not just cooks \\
