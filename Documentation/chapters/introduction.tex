In the past years the industry put an emphasise on being the fastest and most efficient. Takeaway is getting more and more popular. Next day delivery is not as rare as it used to be and products are rarely hand made. 
Optimizing the process plays a big role in that. A simple example can be cooking, where the order of tasks significantly impacts the efficiency. When following a recipe, you have to think in advance what you will need, and how much time it will take. If you don't turn on the oven before starting, you might waste time waiting for it to heat up later. In our project we will be trying to find an optimal ordering of tasks, to make the cooking process more efficient. This way recipes can be done quicker and the work can be better distributed. \\

For our starter recipe simulation we choose tried to choose something basic. The recipe that came to mind was the dish Goulash. Here is the following recipe:

As you can see it includes a lot of different ingredients and cutting tasks, which are fairly simple to include in our simulation but help set the start model. Furthermore it is a recipe where the order of the tasks is of high importance, which is something you have to be aware of when cooking. 

For our second recipe we chose the dish named Potatoe salad. We made our choice cause on this dish we can show the importance of the task order and the best time management. This dish includes a lot of tasks of cutting and boiling. 

The recipe of Potatoe salad is following:
